# GiantBombDL v1 (6-1-2021)

`python GiantBombDL.py -h`

Tested with Python 3.8.5

Requires wget, benefits from ffmpeg, ffprobe, and AtomicParsley

Need to place API key in the code.

Verify was working, I think. 

Minimum / maximum length only a basic implementation, e.g. I believe it's not suited to multi-page results.

Metadata editing not implemented.

Tries to detect rate-limiting.
